 * ONOS GUI -- Layer -- Flash Component

 * Replaces Flash Service in old GUI.
 * Provides a mechanism to flash short informational messages to the screen
 * to alert the user of something, e.g. "Hosts visible" or "Hosts hidden".
 *
 * It can be used in a warning mode, where text will appear in red
 * The dwell time (milliseconds) can be controlled or the default is 1200ms
 *
 * To use add an element to the template like
 *   <onos-flash message="Hosts visible" dwell="2000" warning="true"></onos-flash>
 * This whole element can be disabled until needed with an ngIf, but if this is done
 * the animated fade-in and fade-out will not happen
 * There is also a (closed) event that tells you when the message is closed, or
 * fades-out
